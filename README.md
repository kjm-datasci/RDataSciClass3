=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

Within the UCI HAR Dataset folder, there are two folers:
========================================= 
- 'test'
- 'train'

Within the test folder, there are the following three files:
=========================================  
- 'X_test.txt': This included the Test dataset.

- 'y_test.txt': Test labels.

Within the train folder, there are the following three files:
